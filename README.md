## Problem

- **Difficulty in Choosing a Personalized Gift**: Finding a unique gift that matches the recipient's preferences can be challenging.
- **Choosing Gifts for People You Don't Know Well**: It’s hard to select an appropriate gift for someone with whom you’re not very familiar.
- **Inconvenience of Communicating Your Wishes in Person**: Sharing your gift preferences face-to-face can be awkward or uncomfortable.
- **Time Wasted Searching for Gifts and Purchase Locations**: Finding the perfect gift and the right place to buy it can be time-consuming.
- **Duplicate Gifts**: There is a risk of giving the same gift as someone else.
- **Lack of Wish Structuring**: Organizing and managing wish lists can be disorganized and inefficient.

## Solution that we offer

- **Personalized Wishlists**: By creating a wishlist and specifying all desired gifts, the giver won't face issues with choosing a present. Additionally, the recipient won't need to awkwardly share their gift preferences in person. Instead, they can simply provide a link to their wishlist, which includes preferences across different categories.
- **Gift Purchase Links**: Recipients can include links in the gift information to where the gift can be purchased, saving time and effort for both the recipient and the giver.
- **Gift Tracking Functionality**: The app tracks gifts that have already been chosen by other users. Users can view a list of gifts that have been selected by others, helping to avoid duplicate or repetitive gifts.
- **Private Lists with Detailed Information**: Users can create private lists where they can record their gift wishes, add photos, and provide detailed information about each wish.

- ** Attach Wishlist Items: Add your gift ideas to your own wishlists.
